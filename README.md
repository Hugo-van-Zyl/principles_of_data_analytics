# Principles of Data Analytics
by Hugo van Zyl

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the famous Iris dataset, originally collected by R.A. Fisher. The project demonstrates various data analysis and visualization techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python installed along with the following libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy

You can utilize an appropriate Python IDE like VS Code or Jupyter Notebooks (through Anaconda suite) to run this code. 

## Dataset Overview
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of pattern recognition and machine learning. It contains:
- 150 samples (50 from each of three Iris flower species)
- 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- 3 target classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

The dataset is sourced directly from scikit-learn's built-in datasets module.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- tasks.ipynb         (Main Jupyter notebook containing all analysis tasks)
- README.md           (Project documentation)
- .gitignore          (Git ignore file)

## Task Breakdown
The project is divided into 10 distinct tasks, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis:
1. Data Sourcing: Importing the Iris dataset from sklearn
2. Data Structure Exploration: Examining dataset shape and contents
3. Data Summarization: Computing statistical measures
4. Feature Visualization: Creating histograms for each feature
5. Relationship Investigation: Creating scatter plots between features
6. Regression Analysis: Adding regression lines to scatter plots
7. Class Distribution Analysis: Creating box plots by species
8. Correlation Analysis: Computing and visualizing correlation coefficients
9. Linear Regression: Calculating and displaying coefficient of determination
10. Comprehensive Visualization: Creating pairplots for all features

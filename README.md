# Principles of Data Analytics
by Hugo van Zyl

# Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the famous Iris dataset, originally collected by R.A. Fisher. The project demonstrates various data analysis and visualization techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python installed along with the following libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy

# Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of pattern recognition and machine learning. It contains:

- 150 samples (50 from each of three Iris flower species)
- 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- 3 target classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

The dataset is sourced directly from scikit-learn's built-in datasets module.
